# nthfromlast
Add a method to the LList class that would find the nth value from the end of the list. For example:  Given list A  B  C  D  E  F  G  a call to NthFromEnd(3)  would return E and a call NthFromEnd(6) would return B.  If the parameter is greater than the number of elements in the list then the program should return an Error Message.
